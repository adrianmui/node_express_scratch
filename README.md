# This is a simple Node ExpressJS application

## From what I understand so far:

* ExpressJS is similarity to that of a micro-backend framework such as Sinatra
* Unlike Rails, .NET, Spring, ExpressJS requires you to choose your middleware stacks(which are basically javascript functions that handle the request, filters it with js functions, and adds a callback to another middleware stack and/or returns a response)
